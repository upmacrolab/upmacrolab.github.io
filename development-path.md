# UP-Macrolab development path 

## Administrative 
11-04-2024
* We do not have a private github account, meaning anyone can access our code. 
* Because we don't have a backend, this isn't too much of a problem. More a question of whether we want people to access the underlying data 


## Austhetics 
11-04-2024
* Change team pictures (Tumi)
* Update news 
    * Current understanding is that we need to create more .yml files to bring up news, and then commit and push these files to github 
    * Super cumbersome but there is an easy workaround to automating the git pull/push requests (script)
    * The news, however, will be more difficult. We need to find a simple way to add nes 
* Updates to the austhetics??? 


## Functionality 
11-04-2024
* Functionality is an issue (no backend)
* Email is an issue 
* Storing data is an issue (no post)
* Sharing data is an issue (no get)
